# Face-recognition-based-Attendence-System
This is a real-time face detection and attendance marking system built with Flask, OpenCV, and MongoDB. The application uses your computer's webcam to detect faces and match them against a database of registered students. When a face is recognized, it automatically records their attendance with a timestamp in a MongoDB Atlas database.
